# Elevate-Labs-Task-6
🔐 Online Free Password Strength Checker
This project was completed as part of a Cyber Security Internship. It focuses on understanding what makes a password strong and how to evaluate password strength using freely available online tools.

📌 Objective
To learn how password complexity impacts security and to test various passwords using an online password strength checker tool.

🧰 Tools Used
PasswordMeter.com — an online password strength evaluation tool.

🧪 What Was Done
Created multiple passwords of varying complexity — from simple to strong.

Tested those passwords using the Password Strength Meter tool.

Analyzed results to understand how different factors affect password strength.

✅ Best Practices for Strong Passwords
Use 12+ characters whenever possible.

Combine uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols.

Avoid dictionary words or predictable patterns.

Don’t reuse passwords across websites.

Use a password manager to generate and store strong passwords securely.

💡 Key Learnings
Password length significantly improves strength.

Random characters are stronger than predictable patterns like P@ssw0rd123.

Passphrases (e.g., PurpleTigerBananaSkateboard!) can be secure and memorable.

Complexity ≠ strength if based on common substitutions.

⚠️ Common Password Attacks
Brute Force: Every combination is tried; long random passwords resist this.

Dictionary Attack: Uses lists of common words and variations.

Credential Stuffing: Exploits reused passwords from breached sites.

Phishing: Tricks users into giving up passwords.

🔐 Summary
Password strength is largely determined by its length, randomness, and entropy. Strong passwords protect against automated attacks and reduce vulnerability to breaches. This project highlights the importance of password hygiene in cybersecurity.
